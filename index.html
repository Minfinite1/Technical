    <section class="main-section" id="History">
    <header>History</header>
    <p>Aviation has its roots in the early 20th century, with pioneers like the Wright brothers, who made the first successful powered flight in 1903. Since then, aviation technology has rapidly evolved, leading to jet propulsion, supersonic flight, and modern airliners.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Early Developments:</strong> The Wright brothers' first flight in Kitty Hawk.</li>
      <li><strong>Jet Age:</strong> The introduction of commercial jets in the 1950s, such as the Boeing 707.</li>
      <li><strong>Supersonic Flight:</strong> Concorde, the first supersonic airliner, started service in 1976.</li>
      </ul>
      <code class="add-info">The development of aviation has dramatically changed global transportation, making travel faster and more accessible.</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="How_Planes_Work">
      <header>How Planes Work</header>
      <p>Airplanes rely on fundamental principles of physics to achieve and maintain flight. Four main forces are involved:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lift:</strong> Generated by the wings to overcome gravity.</li>
        <li><strong>Thrust:</strong> Produced by engines to move the aircraft forward.</li>
        <li><strong>Drag:</strong> The resistance against the aircraft’s motion.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight:</strong> The force pulling the aircraft toward the Earth.</li>
      </ul>
      <code class="add-info">The interaction of these forces is balanced through aerodynamics to enable controlled flight.</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Components">
      <header>Components</header>
      <p>An airplane consists of several critical parts, each serving a specific purpose in flight.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wings:</strong> Generate lift and provide stability</li>
        <li><strong>Engines:</strong> Provide thrust to propel the aircraft.</li>
        <li><strong>Fuselage:</strong> The main body that houses passengers, cargo, and controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Empennage:</strong> The tail section, providing stability and control (rudder and elevators).</li>
        <li><strong>Landing Gear:</strong> Includes wheels or skids for takeoff, landing, and taxiing.</li>
      </ul>
      <code class="add-info">Each component works together to ensure the safe and efficient operation of an aircraft.</code>
